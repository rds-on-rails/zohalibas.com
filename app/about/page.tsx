                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                        Founded in 2009, Zoha Libas began as a humble initiative to bring timeless elegance and authentic Indian craftsmanship to
                        women's fashion. What started as a small venture has blossomed into a recognized brand in Balrampur, Uttar Pradesh,
                        known for its dedication to quality, tradition, and style.

                        At the heart of Zoha Libas lies the vision of <span className="font-bold italic text-[#7C0000]">Mohammad Ishtiyaq</span>,
                        whose passion and perseverance laid the foundation for everything we stand for today. His legacy continues to
                        inspire our journey, shaping each design with the same care and commitment that defined his work.
                        Every thread we weave and every silhouette we craft is a tribute to his memory.
